					My name is Joseph Goergen and I am in my 3rd year of college.
					My family lives in a very very small town of Adams Minnesota which conisist of
					less than 800 in total populations size(you can even check the census <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams,_Minnesota" id="census"> here</a>). 
					While I at the moment live in Winona Minnesota temporarily, my high school class size was very small and had less than 40 kids in my graduating class.
					I am getting a major in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics, I choose Computer Science as my major because I love the 
					satisfaction of finally getting the program to work correctly after hours of trying to figure it out, I see it as more as solving a puzzle.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have a lovely Mother and Father named Connie and Dennis as well as a brother Mike, and a sister Holly. We also have 2 pets, one 
					oversized beagle named Leroy and one black and white cat named Dice.
					When I was in high school I was part of a acapella boy band called the <i>Four-Man Trio</i> and there were 5 of us, yes we know how to count.

				What I incorporated:
				I rounded the corners of my pictures so that it is not a hard corner.
				I also separated the link from the nav so I could change the background of just the hyperlink and not the entire width of the screen for the nav.
				I turned the background pink when you highlight over the four-man trio and census link.
