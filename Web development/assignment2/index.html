				The Four-Man Trio is a group of 5 men that attended Southland High School is rural Adams 
				Minnesota and were in the graduating class of 2015. In 2012, the Four-Man Trio was just
				that, a four man singing group consisting of Marvin Heimer, Colten Allen, Boyd Mortenson,
				and Maxwell Tapp. In 2013, Joseph Goergen joined high school choir and ended up joining 
				the group and all decided to stick with the original name since it seemed funny and unorthodox.

				The group of 5 men very much enjoyed singing as a group, at first to get attention but then
				they quickly built a fan-base from there. The men started out singing as a group with the help
				of Jenna Steinkamp who would either compose the men, play the songs on the piano for them or
				both at the same time. The Four-Man Trio also enjoyed not only just singing along with a piano
				but without one as well, they loved singing acapella not only for the sound that is produced 
				but also for the difficulty that brought along with singing without instruments.

				The group of 5 would go to contests to compete with other groups and usually came back
				victorious with a Superior or the highest performance rank. At these competitions, the men
				would like to have fun, make friends with other choir people from other schools and could
				be seen doing ridiculous things such as going up and down elevators singing for each floor
				the door opens up to. Sometimes Marvin Heimer would bring his guitar and get not just the
				Trio, but around 15 random people to sing songs that most people know.

				In 2015, the men's senior year of high school, they decided to go all out and with the help
				of Kari Kuehneman, they decided to make album covers and T-Shirts. The men themselves
				have exclusive t-shirts and even some album covers that have not yet been released...until today.
